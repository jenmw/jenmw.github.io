                    <p>I’m very passionate about buying used clothes so I use the eBay app every day. I quite often came across frustrating experiences as a user myself, so I wanted to find out if others had negative experiences, and think of ways to solve problems.</p>

                    <h3 id="gatheringuserdata">Gathering user data</h3>
                    <p>From my own experience I found that accessing items that are ending soon is more difficult 
                        than it needs to be, and sometimes I forget about items ending soon. Also I found that items are often repeated multiple times in search results, 
                        and that gives a feeling of deja vu that isn't conducive to a good experience! This suggested to me that the home and search pages needed an overhaul. I decided to gather data from 
                        other users to affirm my own experience and scope any other user issues.</p>
                    <p> Taking to the eBay Community Message Boards, I sent a questionnaire and received 11 responses. 
                        When asked what task they use the app for most, 73% said they use the app for buying compared to
                        27% for selling. So for the purpose of this project I’ve focused more on features related to
                        buying than selling.</p>
                    <p>I also wanted to gauge how important certain things were to users on screen so that I could
                        establish some kind of hierarchy of information. So I asked users to say, from a limited list of
                        features, whether they used them “most or every time”, “occasionally”, “rarely”, or “never”.
                    </p>
                    <p>The two highest ranking features are saved searches and watched items, so this project 
                        will focus on those two features in particular and how to reflect their importance to users. 
                        Interestingly, some features aimed at buying such as today’s deals ranked very low, suggesting 
                        that this feature isn’t valued by users, though admittedly my sample is very small and 
                        would need greater analysis to confirm.</p>

                    <p style="padding-top:2%">From the survey results I generated two user stories based on the two most commonly used
                        features.</p>

                    <!-- <figcaption class="caption-left"><h4>Wireframes showing user flow</h4></figcaption> -->
                    <p>Firstly, the left most sketch shows the home screen, in which my redesign doesn't change in page layout so much, but the order of things have changed. Namely Watched Items appear at the first section below the search bar. From the first user story we can determine that Watched items must be very easy to see and act upon, so I've placed them at the very top and by default ordered them by ending soonest. The blue line indicates that tapping on an item photo or title will take you to that item's page to display more information and allow you to take action upon that item.</p>
                    <p>The search bar itself has not changed in design, but following the red line you will find the search results page has changed, items appearing more separate with information displayed in boxes to make processing the information easier and pre-batched. The button to save the search is made much larger as well, as per the second user story emphasising the importance of saving searches. </p>
                    <p>Additionally from the home screen the green line shows the action of navigating to saved searches, which again the second user story emphasises. The button to do this has been added to the home screen as previously users would have to know to go to the side menu accessed via the burger menu icon.</p>
                    <p>The right-most sketch shows the new design for saved searches, which have editing features to change or delete the search available in one click, instead of the current page in which you have to open editing mode. There's also a larger button for sorting saved searches to make this feature more obvious, allowing users to view their searches in different ways, since the user story talks about viewing as well as modifying searches.</p>

                        incorporates some deeper, richer, earthier tones. Many signs point towards earth tones being a
                        trend for 2020. Pantone 2020 Colour of the Year is a very deep blue! The lighter swatches in the
                        Highlights palette for accents pair very nicely with the Secondary swatches.</p>
